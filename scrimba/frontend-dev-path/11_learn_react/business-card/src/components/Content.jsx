        <p>
          I am a front-end developer experienced in JavaScript, Tailwind CSS and react. I have used these skills to
          build websites and apps, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I believe that
          technology can help us to think logically and be ourselves, and I am excited to use my skills to make a
          positive impact on the world.
