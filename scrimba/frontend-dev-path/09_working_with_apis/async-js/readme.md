# What is Async-JS?

It's code that can be run "out of order". Allows a lengthy operation to start, but finish at a later time without blocking other code from running in the meantime.

# Javascript is not asynchronous

Javascript isn't truly asynchronous but rather has `"callback"` mechanisms in place to run commands in a different order to make things more efficient.

- Single-threaded means only one command can run at a time

# Callbacks
