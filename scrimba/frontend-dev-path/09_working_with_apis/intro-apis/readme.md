# API's

## What is an API?

An API stands out for Application Programming Interface, which allows you to have interactivity within your website.

# Endpoints

- An endpoint is a URL that is used to access a resource on a server. It could be a file, information, or a service.

- The endpoint must be protected from unauthorized users, sometimes using a token or a key like an API key.

# API's used

- DOM API (.getElementById, .querySelector, .addEventListener, etc.)
- Array methods API (.map, .filter, .reduce, etc.)

A `client` is any device that connects to the internet to get data from somewhere (`server`) and make requests to it.

## Server

A `server` is a computer that is connected to the internet and is waiting for requests from clients asking for something, then responds to the client with a thing (response).
