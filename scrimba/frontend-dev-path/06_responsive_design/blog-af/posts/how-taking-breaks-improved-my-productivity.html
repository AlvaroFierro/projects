            <h2>Taking breaks...</h2>
            <p>
              You're working on a complex problem at work or a side project, and
              the deadline is in one week. Will you convince yourself that you
              do not have the time to take breaks? Probably I would do it. So,
              can we take breaks and still be productive?
            </p>
            <h2>Why Taking Breaks Is Important</h2>
            <p>
              When I first started learning how to code, I used to work for
              hours on end without taking any breaks, from 12 PM to 1 AM, only
              stopping for lunch and dinner. However, I always felt drained and
              tired, and I wasn't enjoying the journey. At times, my motivation
              was so low that I started to question if I was cut out to be a
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's when I decided to take a few days off to reassess my goals.
              During that time, I discovered the importance of taking breaks and
              researched ways to improve my productivity while learning to code.
              I found out that I had experienced burnout without even realizing
              it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many of us fall into the trap of not taking breaks while working
              on a difficult task, feeling that we don't deserve a break until
              the job is done. However, this mindset is not sustainable in the
              long run.
            </p>

            <h2>The ultradian rhythm</h2>
            <p>
              In 2022 when I was discovering a way to overcome my burnout and
              achieve my goals. So I did a bit of research, and while doing it I
              found something that I'd never heard about it, the ultradian
              rhythm.
            </p>

            <p>Simply, your body is built by 4 biological rhythms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>circadian rhythms:</b> a 24-hour cycle that includes
                physiological and behavioral rhythms like sleeping.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>diurnal rhythms:</b> synchronized with the day/night cycle.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>infradian rhythms:</b> last more than 24 hours, such as a
                menstrual cycle.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>ultradian rhythms:</b> biological rhythm with a shorter
                period and higher frequency than circadian rhythms.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The word ultradian means "many times a day". So this rhythm has a
              short period, less than 24 hours. But occurs many times a day. And
              this rhythm can have a powerful effect on your body, like boosting
              your productivity and happiness.
            </p>

            <p>On paper, looks like this</p>
            <img
              src="https://www.bluezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-2.13.14-PM-760x480.png"
              alt="Ultradian rhythm"
            />

            <p>
              As you can see in the image, the suggested ultradian rhythm is 90
              minutes of high productivity followed by 20 minutes of rest.
              However, the maximum recommended period is 120 minutes of work and
              27 minutes of rest. Rest periods can even be as long as 30 minutes
              😉.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've tried many productivity hacks, but none of them worked for me
              in the long run. However, since I started following my natural
              ultradian rhythm in November 2022, I've seen significant
              improvements in my productivity and motivation.
            </p>

            <h2>Following your natural ultradian rhythm is a life changer</h2>
            <p>
              The first days that I tried this rhythm I can't focus for any more
              than 30 minutes without any distractions, also I felt like my
              brain was connecting those neurons, along with a headache. But you
              know why? I was happy, I felt like a was doing a little bit of
              work, although it was taking more time than planned.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I take another step, using productivity apps like google
              calendar, windows clock, and todoist (not sponsored). Here's how I
              scheduled myself.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>todoist: </b>used to write down my to-do's and reminders also
                I'm using the integration with google calendar.
              </li>

              <li><b>windows clock:</b> use the focus sessions.</li>

              <li>
                <b>google calendar:</b> the integration with todoist allowed me
                to set reminders in the future and set some goals.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This allowed me to manage my time more effectively and achieve my
              goals, and you know what? At the end of the day, I was studying
              happier and also with more motivation throughout the same
              schedule. It's better to work smart than hard, this means, working
              less but efficiently (with the ultradian rhythm), not the
              opposite.
            </p>

            <h2>How you can also take breaks and be productive?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, you can take breaks and be productive at the same time!
              However, it takes effort to get into the habit of taking breaks.
              Here are some tips to help you get started:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>do not think always is gonna be easy:</b> I've to admit that
                sometimes is easier than other days. In the beginning, you've to
                get used to this new workflow.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>don't try to get all 90 minutes in one go:</b> begin with
                maybe 30 minutes or with a pomodoro session, and then you can go
                up. Otherwise, you'll feel frustrated.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>consistency is the key:</b> try to be consistent every day
                and in the long term you'll be more productive. Remember one day
                at a time.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>use a productivity app</b> as I did, whatever you like, and
                write down your goals. When completed strike it out. It will
                help you to see you're not stuck.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>track your activity with a complementary app</b>, if you're a
                windows user just use the clock app, which is simple to use. Set
                the desired time and skip the breaks to get into the flow zone
                🔥.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to do in breaks?</h2>
            <p>
              Try to change the activity you were doing, eg: if you were
              sitting, go for a walk, especially if your work includes sitting
              all day. If you were staring at your computer/phone/tablet keep
              your eyes out of the screen, they will appreciate it a lot.
            </p>

            <p>But you can also...</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hit the restroom</b> (even if you don't think you've to go)
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Take a walk:</b> Fresh air and movement can help clear your
                mind and recharge your batteries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Read a book or listen to an audiobook:</b> This can help
                stimulate your mind and broaden your knowledge.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b> Eat a healthy snack:</b> Nourish your body with a nutritious
                snack to help maintain your energy levels throughout the day.
              </li>

              <li>Get a snack or drink water.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Remember,
