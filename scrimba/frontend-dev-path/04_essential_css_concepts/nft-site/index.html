            If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a great
            way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or
            even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and
            spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice:
            spend the weekend <a href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time
            next week, you'll be a millionaire.

            Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk
            (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a
            total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS Code
            screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text on
            a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.

            Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're
            selling them, not buying them.
