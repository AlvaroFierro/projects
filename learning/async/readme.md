# Async

An async code is something that happens when another process is executing. This lets you execute another process, while something is being processed

JS capabilities:

- Is single threaded
- Blocked (async code)
- Event loop: waits to certain block of code to execute it

# Callbacks

Is a function that it's passed as an argument to another function and it'll be invoked

# Promises

Non-blocked async functions that can return a value now, in the future or never

# Async/await (ES2017)

Let you structure an synchronous function without blocking, as an sync function does.

# Event loop

Is a design pattern that waits and share events or messages inside a program

# Memory Heap

Objects are stores to an space in memory

# Call STack

It organizes your programs with LIFO Last-In First-Out

# Task queue

You work with concurrency, you add the task that are ready to go to the stack.

The `stack` must be empty

# MicroTask Queue

Promises have another way to execute and has a higher priority

# Web APIs

`setTimeout`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `File Reader`, `DOM`

`Node:fs`, `https`
